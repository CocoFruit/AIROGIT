# Example of a good commit message:
title: Rename main.py to airogit.py and add commit message autofill function
body: The commit includes the following changes:
- Renaming the file main.py to airogit.py
- Added a new function to autofill the commit summary from the staged changes

The renaming of the file was done to improve the clarity and consistency of the codebase. 
Additionally, the new function will make it easier for developers to create commit messages 
by automatically populating the summary based on the staged changes. This will save time and
ensure that commit messages follow the required format.

Note: Further improvements can be made to handle multiple files and refine the autofill logic.
