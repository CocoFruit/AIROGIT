To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow the steps below:

1. Read the input integer t, which represents the number of test cases.
2. Iterate t times to process each test case.
3. Read the input integer n, which represents the length of the array a.
4. Read the elements of the array a.
5. Initialize a variable operations with the value 0.
6. While the array a is not sorted (meaning it does not satisfy a1 <= a2 <= ... <= an), perform the following steps:
   6.1. Iterate over each element ai in the array a.
   6.2. If ai > ai-1, update ai with ai-1 (replace ai with max(0, ai-1)), and increment operations by 1.
   6.3. If no element in the array a is updated during the iteration, break the loop as the array is sorted.
7. Output the value of operations for the current test case.
8. Repeat steps 3-7 for each remaining test case.
9. End the program.
