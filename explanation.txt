To solve the problem "Buttons," we can follow these steps:

1. Read the number of test cases, t, from the input.
2. Repeat the following steps t times:
   3. Read the values of a, b, and c from the input.
   4. Calculate the maximum number of turns that can be played. Since both girls take turns, the maximum number of turns is a + b.
   5. Check if c is greater than or equal to the maximum number of turns. If it is, output "First" because Anna can press all the buttons before the game ends, and Katie won't have any buttons left to press.
   6. If c is smaller than the maximum number of turns, check if a is smaller than or equal to b. If it is, output "First" because Anna can press all the buttons that only she can press, and the game will end before Katie's turn.
   7. If a is greater than b, output "Second" because Katie can always mirror Anna's moves by pressing the buttons that Anna presses, leaving Anna with no buttons to press on her turn.
8. End of the program.
