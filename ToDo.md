# TO DO

## Genearal
- [x] Create a repository for the project
- [x] Create a README
- [x] Create a ToDo

## Research
- [ ] Figure out which LLM I want to use

## System Design and Architecture
- [ ] Define the characteristics and capabilities of individual agent (skills, communication abilities, and decision-making strategies)
- [ ] Design the structure of the multi-agent system, including agent representation, communication channels, and task management components.

## Task Decomposition
- [ ] Develop an algorithm for breaking down the main task into smaller sub-tasks.
- [ ] Implement a mechanism for assigning sub-tasks to agents based on their capabilities and workload.
- [ ] Consider different approaches for task decomposition, such as specialization, workload balancing, and dependencies.

## Agent Collaboration
- [ ] Design communication protocols for agents to exchange information and updates.
- [ ] Implement negotiation mechanisms for agents to agree on task assignments and share progress.
- [ ] Develop methods for sub-task handoff and coordination between agents.
