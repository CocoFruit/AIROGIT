**AIROGIT** (*AI-Related Overview and Git Information Tool*) is an innovative tool designed to simplify and enhance your Git version control workflow. Our ultimate goal is to empower developers with automated commit messages and descriptions using advanced Language Model technology. This ensures that your Git history is clear, informative, and consistent. AIROGIT seamlessly integrates with GIT-COLA's Git GUI, making it the ultimate solution for streamlining your versioning process.

## Features

- **LLM-Powered Commit Messages**: AIROGIT leverages cutting-edge Language Model technology to analyze your code changes and generate meaningful commit messages and descriptions.

- **Efficiency and Consistency**: Say goodbye to the hassle of manual commit message creation. AIROGIT promotes consistency, reduces confusion, and ensures your commit messages are well-formed.

- **Seamless GIT-COLA Integration**: AIROGIT seamlessly integrates into [GIT-COLA's Git GUI](https://github.com/git-cola/git-cola), offering a familiar and user-friendly experience for developers.
