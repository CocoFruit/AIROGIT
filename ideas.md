# Idea List #

## Main Project Ideas ##
### What Makes This Project Unique? ###
* Other projects create static agent roles, but this project will allow agents to dynamically change roles based on the task at hand.

## General Questions ##

* Could I use an base agent to generate a set of base agents with characteristics specific to the task?
* How do I allow agents to learn from each other?
* How do I break down the task into subtasks?
    * Maybe I could use an agent to break down the task into subtasks
* How do I assign subtasks to agents?
* Maybe the roles could be similar to those in a software development team (i.e. project manager, developer, tester, etc.) 


## Agent Role Ideas ##

* **Manager**
    * Breaks down the task into subtasks
    * Creates goals, schedules, and assigns the tasks to agents
* **Researcher**
    * Gathers information about the task
* **Creator**
    * The creator is reposible for creating more specific agents
