## Version 1.9.0 (2019-07-23)

### New features

* Add the FORCE_QT_API environment variable to keep using the Qt
  bindings selected with the QT_API variable and avoid switching
  to the currently imported bindings. This allows to have
  applications that import PySide and PyQt bindings at the same
  time (which is possible if both bindings are compiled for the
  same Qt version).

### Issues Closed

* [Issue 195](https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy/issues/195) - Errors in the Qt3D modules with PySide2 5.12.4+ and Python 2 ([PR 196](https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy/pull/196))
